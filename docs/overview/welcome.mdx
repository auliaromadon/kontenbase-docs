## Introduction

[Kontenbase](https://kontenbase.com) allows you to easily create backend API, auth, and storage in less than 1 minute without coding.

Think of it as a very simple alternative of:

- JSON Placeholder
- Express.js
- hapi.js
- AdonisJS
- Postman
- Insomnia
- Strapi
- Firebase
- Supabase
- and other API-focused tools

Kontenbase is a no-code backend API platform, or Backend as a Service (BaaS), that allows you to create a backend API as fast as possible. We enable developers to build backend API (currently focused on REST API) without having to touch backend code at all.

If you are a frontend developer, you can create a backend API without the need to create your backend from scratch. Or even more, if you are a backend developer, you can create a backend API without deploying it yourself. But of course, it's still possible to create a custom backend service too.
