# Blog with Simple Service

## Create or login to the account

First of all, create a new account or log in to your existing account. Currently, we only support Google Account or Gmail at the moment.

## Create a project

Then create a project, we can name it "Writter".

## Private Wreets

This is the dashboard.

Which shows we don't have any service yet.

Let's create a new service called "Wreets", and the type is "Private".

It will generate the default REST API with available requests such as `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, and `DELETE`.

## Customize Wreets fields

Now let's customize the `Wreets` fields so we can have:

- `content` as a string of multi-line text
- `createdAt` as a string of datetime.

## Create some wreets

Alright, time to create some wreets by using the `POST` request.

- Authentication: ...
- Content: Just setting up my Writter.

Send the request, and receive the response of the created Wreet.

For the content itself, you are free to use any format either plain text, Markdown, or HTML. Because the decision to render that is up to you in the frontend.

## Find or get the wreets

After creating the wreet, then we can find them with the `GET` request.

Send the request, and receive the response to the wreets.

We can also copy the full URL and put it in the browser or your favorite REST API Client to see.

## Update or patch a wreet

Next, we can also update one of the wreets with the `PATCH` request.

Get the `id` of the wreet we want to update, change the fields, and it will be updated.

## Remove or delete a wreet

Let's try to delete one of them with the `DELETE` request.

Get the `id` of the wreet we want to delete, enter it, and it will be deleted.
