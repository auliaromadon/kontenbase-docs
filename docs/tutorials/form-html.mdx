## Expected results

(There will be some screenshots here)

## Services or REST API Endpoints

There will be only two services with their REST API endpoints or functionalities:

Storage and Names

We name the services in plural because that's what is usually recommended for naming the endpoints in REST API.

- Storage
  - `GET` Find all files
  - `POST` Post one file
  - `DELETE` Remove one file
- Names
  - `GET` Find all authors
    - `GET` Find one or more authors with a filter
  - `GET` Find record by ID
  - `POST` Create one author
  - `PATCH` Update one author
  - `DELETE` Remove one author

# Fields or Data Structure

- Names
  - `_id`: UUID
  - `name`: string | single-line text
  - `createdAt`: date | createdAt

Notes: You can blank the field name and it will generate field name like the choosen data structure

# Plain Form HTML with Simple Service

## Create or login to your account

First of all, create a new account or log in to your existing Kontenbase account. Currently, we only support Google Account or Gmail at the moment.

## Create a project or workspace

Then create a project or workspace, we can name it "Form HTML".

## Public Names

This is the workspace.

That shows we don't have any service yet.

Let's create a new service called "names", and the type is "Public".

It will generate the default REST API with available requests such as `GET`, `POST`, `PATCH`, and `DELETE`.

## Customize Article fields

Now let's customize the `Names` fields so we can have `names` as a string of single-line text and `createdAt` as a date.

## Create some Names

Alright, time to create some names by using the `POST` request.

- Name : Harry

Send the request, and receive the created name with JSON API response format.

Let's create another one:

- Name : Ron

## Find or get the names

After creating the names, then we can find them with the `GET` request.

Notice that right now we are only "Authenticated as Public".

Send the request, and receive the response to the names.

We can also copy the full URL and put it in the browser or your favorite REST API Client to see the recrds.

## Filter names

The filter is available. We can find one or more names with conditions using filter. Such as find names that containing particular word. 

## Sort names

Sorting names to ascending or descending from certain field is easy.

## Pagination

We may also use pagination in order to get certain amount of data from a huge data you had.

## Update or patch a name

Next, we can also update one of the names with the `PATCH` request.

Get the `id` of the names we want to update, fill the name field with the up-to-date information, and it will be updated.

## Remove or delete a name

Let's try to delete one of them with the `DELETE` request.

Get the `id` of the name we want to delete, enter it, and it will be deleted.

## Closing

And that's it. We made a very simple "Plain Names Form HTML" project backend API with Kontenbase. ðŸŽ‰
