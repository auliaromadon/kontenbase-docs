**Think of it as a very simple alternative of:**
- JSON Placeholder
- Postman
- Strapi
- Firebase
- Supabase
- and other API-focused tools

Kontenbase is focused on enabling developers (especially front-end developers) to build back-end API (currently focused on REST API) without having to touch backend code at all.

But of course, it's still possible to create a custom backend service too.
